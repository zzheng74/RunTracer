# RunTracer

This application helps users plan running routes. Users can click on a map to create waypoints and then create a route by connecting those waypoints. The resulting distance of the route is then calculated so that users will know how long the running route will be in terms of miles and kilometers.

Version 1.0


## Requirements

In order to load the map in the browser, you will need to replace some parts of RunTracer.html with your own Google Maps API key. Your API key should replace the two spots in the code where it says "INSERT_API_KEY" on lines 7 and 20.

## Instructions

To find a starting location on the map, you can first search a location using the search bar at the top. Then, click on a few checkpoints on the map that you plan on passing during your running route. This will generate a route on the map and the distance will be displayed at the bottom right. Use the Undo or Clear buttons if you made a mistake with a checkpoint or want to start over with drawing your route.
